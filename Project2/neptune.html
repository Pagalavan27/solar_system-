            <h3>About Venus</h3>
            <br>
            <p class="venus_p">Venus is the second planet from the Sun in our solar system and is often referred to as Earth's "sister planet" due to its similar size and composition. However, Venus has some extreme and unique characteristics:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Atmosphere: Venus has a thick atmosphere composed mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid. This dense atmosphere creates a strong greenhouse effect, making Venus the hottest planet in the solar system, with surface temperatures around 467°C (872°F).</li>
                <li>Surface: The surface of Venus is rocky and covered with numerous volcanoes and vast plains. It has many large volcanic features, including the Maxwell Montes, the highest mountain on Venus, which is taller than Mount Everest.</li>
                <li>Rotation: Venus has a very slow and retrograde rotation, meaning it rotates in the opposite direction to most planets in the solar system, including Earth. It takes about 243 Earth days to complete one rotation, but only 225 Earth days to complete one orbit around the Sun, making a day on Venus longer than its year</li>
                <li>No Moons: Venus does not have any moons or rings.                </li>
                <li>Potential for Life: The conditions on the surface of Venus are extremely inhospitable for life as we know it due to the high temperatures and pressures. However, some scientists have speculated about the possibility of microbial life existing in the more temperate upper layers of the Venusian atmosphere, where temperatures and pressures are more Earth-like.</li>
